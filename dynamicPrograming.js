// It breaks down the complex problem into simpler subproblems.
// It finds the optimal solution to these sub-problems.
// It stores the results of subproblems (memoization). The process of storing the results of subproblems is known as memorization.
// It reuses them so that same sub-problem is calculated more than once.
// Finally, calculate the result of the complex problem.
